# PlanckFunctions.jl

## General description
PlanckFunctions.jl is designed to calculate the Planck's function thermal emission spectra and its derivatives.

- PlanckFunctions.jl package contains several functions to evaluate: 
    - Blackbody spectral intensity (Planck function)
    - The first and the second derivatives of Planck function with respect to the wavelength and temperature 
    - Planck function fast integration over the specified wavelength region 
    - Rosseland- and Planck- averaged attenuation coefficient
